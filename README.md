# Coding Challenge 
## Welcome to the coding challenge for our 2024-2025 year. We are excited to learn more about your coding skills as well as your interests!
### The theme of the coding challenge this year is: 
You can come up with any questions you would like to solve, and the limit is beyond the sky. The only advice is that try to keep the scope of the challenge suitable that you can complete the challenge around 2~3 weeks. 

### Here are the general steps to complete the challenge
1. **Choose a topic**: Select a topic you are interested in. It can be a social issue, a topic in your major field of study, etc. 
2. **Construct a problem statement:** Your problem statement should not exceed 2 sentences. 
3. **Find dataset(s)** that is **NOT PRE-CLEANED**. We would like to see how you clean the data.
4. **Data Cleaning** using different libraries.
5. **Apply appropriate ML/DL** or other models to provide you with results
6. **Adjust your model** to address the specific problem that you solve.
7. **Compute and Interpret** your results.
8. **Complete a short write-up** single-spaced, 11 point font, within 2 pages.
9. **Complete the application** mainly short answers.
10. **Final submission** Submit three parts: Data found online + Code + Write up and short questions on the application. Submit by committing to your private branch cut from this repository.

### The write up:
The write up is the portion where you can demonstrate the complete thought processes when you complete the challenge. The suggested write-up comes with
1. Background information (several sentences, consists of one or two paragraphs)
2. Problem statement (1~2 sentences)
3. Hypothesis (Optional, but could make your write-up more cohesive)
4. Methods (One or multiple paragraphs, feel free to include different models you tried but emphasize on the model(s) you choose to report the results on.
5. Results and Discussion (One or more paragraphs, include any results).
6. Any outside resources that you use

### General tips to complete the coding challenge and application: 
1. Having a problem statement before any actions is generally suggested, but that doesn't mean you cannot modify it as you go!
2. Avoid Kaggle challenge or other online challenge that **HAS DATA PRE-CLEANED FOR YOU**. Cleaning a dataset is an important part of data science project!
3. Try a few ML/DL models first, then decide which model works the best. Try to limit your final submission to 2 ML/DL models or less. 
4. **Explain your code!**. We would like to see how you can communicate the purpose and goal of your code. This is the time where you can show off that you really understand your code, as well as it leaves room for you to explain anything that is otherwise not easy to show on the code. You should aim to explain every important line of your code with 2 short sentences or less.
5. Fine-tune your model(s). Adjust the hyperparameters or other methods so that the accuracy will improve. Even though we do not place a very high emphasis on the accuracy of the results, having tried fine-tuning methods will help you understand your model and your problem statement better.
6. Python is very strongly preferred. We accept submissions both in .py files, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Collab. 
7. In your write up, you are more than welcome or encouraged to include results of other models you have tried. **Note:** In your write up, the ideal length is around 1.5 page, but the priority is that all of your ideas come through. 
8. The entire application should typically take around 8 hours. If you are having difficulties on certain parts of the application, come see one of us during office hour or workshops, or schedule a meeting with one of us!

## Due Dates
The due date for this coding challenge was originally set around fall break time. However, we apologize to set up the submission portal very late, so we are now extending the due date of every part of the application to **Thursday, October 17th at 11:59PM** with a 24-hour grace period until **Friday, October 18th at 11:59PM**. **Note:** To qualify for the grace period, you need to submit at least two of the three portions of the coding challenge completed or almost completed before the due date. For example, you committed the application question and the coding challenge and you need a little bit more time on the write-up before the due date, then you can have the extra day to complete your write-up.
