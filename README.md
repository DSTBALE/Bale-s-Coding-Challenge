# Coding Challenge 
## Welcome to the coding challenge for our 2024-2025 year. We are excited to learn more about your coding skills as well as your interests!
### The theme of the coding challenge this year is: Free!
You can come up with any questions you would like to solve, and the limit is beyond the sky. The only advice is that try to keep the scope of the challenge suitable that you can complete the challenge around 2~3 weeks. 

Here are the general steps to complete the challenge
1. Come up with a topic you are interested in.
2. Construct a problem statement. Your problem statement should not exceed 1 sentence.
3. Find dataset(s) that is **NOT PRE-CLEANED**. We would like to see how you clean the data.
4. Apply appropriate ML/DL or other models to provide you with results
5. Tailor your model to address the specific problem that you solve.
6. Compute and Interpret your results.

Here are some general tips:
1. Having a problem statement before any actions is generally suggested, but that doesn't mean you cannot modify it as you go!
2. Avoid Kaggle challenge or other online challenge that **HAS DATA PRE-CLEANED FOR YOU**. Cleaning a dataset is an important part of data science project!
3. Try a few ML/DL models first
4. **Explain your code!**. We would like to see how you can communicate the purpose and goal of your code. This is the time where you can show off that you really understand your code, as well as it leaves room for you to explain anything that is otherwise not easy to show on the code. You should aim to explain every important line of your code with 2 short sentences or less.
5.
